Here’s a polished and professional `README.md` template tailored to your “AI-AGENT-CHALLENGE” repository, which includes custom parsers and a requirement specification in PDF. This draft assumes the PDF outlines project goals, input/output formats, and parsing behaviors—so feel free to adapt specific details to match your actual PDF content.

# AI Agent Challenge

**A Python-based AI Agent for parsing ICICI financial documents into structured CSV output.**

---

##  Project Overview

This repository implements a custom parsing agent designed to process ICICI bank sample files—both CSV and PDF—and convert them into a unified, structured CSV output.

The solution includes:
- **Custom parsers** built in Python (under `custom_parsers/icici_parser.py`)
- Sample inputs (`icici_sample.csv`, `icici_sample.pdf`)
- Agent orchestration via `agent.py`
- Parser testing via `test_parser1.py`
- Output validation through `parsed_output.csv`

---

##  Features

- Python-powered, modular parsing logic.
- Supports PDF-to-CSV conversion with clear format handling.
- Includes basic testing scaffolding.
- Clean, well-documented code structure.

````

- **`agent.py`**: Drives the parsing process—reads input, invokes parser, writes output.
- **`custom_parsers/icici_parser.py`**: Contains the logic to read and extract relevant data.
- **`data/`**: Houses sample input files for testing and demonstration.
- **`test_parser1.py`**: Validates parser correctness using sample inputs.
- **`parsed_output.csv`**: Expected output for reference and regression checks.

##  Installation & Requirements

###  Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- PDF handling libraries as needed (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`)  
- Testing dependencies (e.g., `pytest` or `unittest`)

###  Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

*(If there’s no `requirements.txt`, simply install your needed packages manually.)*

---

## Usage

### Parsing a Document

To convert a sample ICICI PDF to CSV:

```bash
python agent.py
```

This will:

1. Pick either `icici_sample.pdf` or `icici_sample.csv`
2. Use `icici_parser.py` to process the data
3. Generate `parsed_output.csv` with structured output

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest test_parser1.py
```

Or:

```bash
python -m unittest test_parser1.py
```

---

## PDF Requirements (Based on `icici_sample.pdf`)

*This section should reflect the actual requirements specified in the PDF. Examples might include:*

* PDF contains statement records with columns like Date, Description, Amount, Balance.
* Each record must be parsed into a row with normalized date formats and numeric conversions.
* Handles different PDF layouts, headers, footers, and potential OCR noise gracefully.
* Error-handling for missing or malformed data, with logging or fallback behaviors.

---

## Development Workflow

1. Add new test data to `data/`.
2. Create or update parsing logic in `icici_parser.py`.
3. Write tests in `test_parser1.py` to validate the parsing output.
4. Run `agent.py` to verify end-to-end parsing.
5. Compare generated `parsed_output.csv` with reference output; commit upon success.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Solution                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PDF not parsed correctly | Verify parsing logic and PDF layout handling.                |
| Dependencies missing     | Install required libs (e.g., `pip install pdfminer.six`).    |
| Tests failing            | Compare with reference output and adjust parser accordingly. |

###  Why This Structure Works

- **Clarity & Usability**: Mirrors best practices—project overview, installation, usage examples, tests, and repo structure—from sources such as *Tilburg Science Hub* and *The Good Docs Project* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- **Agent & Human Friendly**: Ensures both humans and potential AI agents can understand project setup and flow; aligns with recommendations to focus on a high-quality README rather than a separate `AGENT.md` unless agent-specific behavior must be documented :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Professional Polish**: Presents a structured, reproducible workflow that anyone (or any automated system) can follow, reducing onboarding friction and improving maintenance.
